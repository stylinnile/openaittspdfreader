OpenAI Whisper TTS API PDF Reader

I find OpenAI has some of the best TTS voices and I wanted a webapp that can read PDFs using their API. So I made one. 

I am an novice Python-er so ChatGPT helped a lot making this so for those experts digging into this please excuse any weird nonsense.

Feel free to clone and add features as you see fit. Ive gotten this to a state of 'I think this works enough' but its very barebones and there a lot more I want to see implemented. Which I may or may not do.
